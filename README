This is Anarchie.pm 1.3, a Perl interface to Anarchie 2.01+.

REQUIREMENTS:
*MacPerl 5.1.1+ (5.1.3 recommended) is REQUIRED for fixed
    AppleEvents library.
*Anarchie 2.01+ or a compatible version of Fetch.
*You might have to give MacPerl an extra meg of memory, I've had some
    problems with it quitting out on me.
*Mac::Apps::Launch is required

To install it, just drop the file Anarchie.pm in the directory
lib:Mac:Apps.  Carefully look over the pod documentation that is included
in the Anarchie.pm file.  You can view it with Shuck (which accompanies 
MacPerl) or with the pod2x translators in the MacPerl pod directory.

This archive can always be obtained from:

    http://pudge.net/macperl/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/CNANDOR/
    http://perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Mac/

The file is a tarred, gzipped file.  Use Stuffit Expander or a
similar program to get at the archive.

I think that is about it.  Let me know how things work out, and any
bugs, typos, suggestions, or anything else.
